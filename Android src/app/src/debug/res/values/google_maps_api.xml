    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    A9:3C:C3:29:03:11:E6:F9:FC:90:C4:8F:36:BD:42:C8:25:56:61:4F

    A9:3C:C3:29:03:11:E6:F9:FC:90:C4:8F:36:BD:42:C8:25:56:61:4F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
